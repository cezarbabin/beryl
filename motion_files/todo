______________________________________________________________

RIGHT BEFORE SHOT
______________________________________________________________

alignment - check coordinates of hip knee shoulder and compute a score based on that
leaning at release - determining the degree of "leaning". we can use the chebyshev center with added weights
foot placement - check the distance between ankles and compute balance or stability
______________________________________________________________

RIGHT AFTER SHOT
______________________________________________________________

low arc on the shot - check elbow/wrist. map as a projectile throwing lever
full follow - check elbow/wrist. complete motion.
interferennce from non-shooting hand. ? 
too much tension in shooting arm. full shoulder extension, elbow extension + wrist
relaxation of the shooting arm. ? 

ball shot too - compute the speed of a throw

Need to automatically segment the motion in order to be able to complete the asessment. 



* The 10 shot challenge 
* May want to use databases only in order to track progress across time
